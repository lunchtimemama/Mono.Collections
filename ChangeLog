	Initial commit. This sets up the project and includes the data structure
	which inspired the project, the good ole ContiguousSplayedRadixTree.
	The CSRT is appropriate when using string keys for lookup into a read-
	only collection of fewer than 65,536 items when many of the keys share
	prefixs. The structure is only half-done: the lookup algorithm is
	written (but not tested), but the constructor is currently empty - there
	is no way to get data into the structure.

	I would like this project to become an effort to learn about, build,
	test and discuss data structures. I personally haven't done serious
	asymptotic analysis or data structure study since college. I usually
	just use one of a few types from System.Collections.Generic: a List
	for storing stuff, a Dictionary for lookup, and a Stack or Queue for
	certain algorithms. I would really like to work with other smart people
	on developing highly specialized data structures and studying their
	performance characteristics. Making these data structures available
	and useful would be nice, but at the moment I'm mainly interested in
	broadening my knowledge of data structures. Anyone interested in joining
	me is more than welcome!
